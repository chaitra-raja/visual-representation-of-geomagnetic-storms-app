# NASA Space App Challenge 2024: May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm Visual Representation

### "The Hidden Forces Behind Auroras and Cosmic Energy"

This project is a visual representation of the May 2024 solar storms, created as part of the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. Utilizing NASA data and creative storytelling, this project aims to educate the public on the impacts of space weather, including solar flares and geomagnetic storms, and how they affect Earth and beyond.

## Features
- *Interactive Visuals*: The homepage features a cosmic background with shooting stars and buttons to navigate through various sections.
- *Multi-page Exploration*: Explore different aspects of solar storms such as Geomagnetic Storms, Solar Flares, and their impacts on Earth and the solar system.
- *Data Visualization*: NASA satellite data has been incorporated to provide a scientific explanation of solar events and their effects.

## How to Use
1. *Clone the repository*:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/chaitra-raja/visual-representation-of-geomagnetic-storms-app.git
    

2. *Open the Project*:
   - Navigate to the cloned directory and open index.html in your browser to experience the homepage with interactive features.

3. *Explore the Solar Storms*:
   - On the homepage, use the navigation buttons to explore:
     - *GEOSTORM*: Learn about geomagnetic storms.
     - *VIIRS*: Insights from the VIIRS satellite.
     - *IMPACTS*: A video demonstration of the impacts.
     - *SOLAR FLARES*: Understand the effects of solar flares.
     - *HOW GMS LOOK LIKE*: Visualize how geomagnetic storms appear.

## Technologies Used
- *HTML5 & CSS3*: For layout, styling, and animations (shooting stars and cosmic background).
- *JavaScript*: For interactivity and dynamic animations (twinkling stars, shooting stars).
- *NASA Data*: Incorporating resources from NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), Parker Solar Probe, and Solar Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).

## Target Audience
This project is designed to be accessible to a broad audience including:
- Students and teachers
- Members of the general public
- Enthusiasts of space and solar phenomena

## Inspiration
Inspired by NASA’s ongoing research on solar storms and space weather, this project aims to make complex heliophysics concepts accessible to everyone. The visual story told here highlights the powerful effects of the Sun’s activity on Earth and the solar system.
